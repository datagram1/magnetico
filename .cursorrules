# Cursor Rules for Magnetico Project

## Testing and Debug Output
- All testing artifacts, debug files, and temporary outputs should be placed in the `tmp/` directory
- Test coverage reports, profiling data, and debug logs should be written to `tmp/`
- Temporary files created during development should use the `tmp/` directory as the base path
- When running tests, ensure any generated files are saved to `tmp/` to keep the project root clean

## Project Structure
- This is a Go project with a modular structure
- Main application logic is in the root directory
- Subdirectories contain specific functionality (bencode, dht, metadata, etc.)
- Web interface is in the `web/` directory
- Installation scripts and documentation are in `install/` directory

## Development Guidelines
- Follow Go best practices and conventions
- Use the existing test patterns in the codebase
- Maintain the current project structure and organization
- Keep temporary and debug files isolated in `tmp/` directory
