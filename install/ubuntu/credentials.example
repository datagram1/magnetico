# Magnetico Web Interface Credentials Example
# Copy this file to /opt/magnetico/credentials and update with your own credentials
# Format: USERNAME:BCRYPT_HASH

# Example credentials (change these!)
# To generate new credentials, use:
# htpasswd -bnBC 12 "username" "password"

# Example user 'admin' with password 'admin123'
admin:$2y$12$YE01LZ8jrbQbx6c0s2hdZO71dSjn2p/O9XsYJpz.5968yCysUgiaG

# Example user 'user' with password 'password'
user:$2y$12$LQv3c1yqBWVHxkd0LHAkCOYz6TtxMQJqhN8/LewdBPj4J/8KzK1aG

# To add more users, run:
# htpasswd -bnBC 12 "newusername" "newpassword" >> /opt/magnetico/credentials

# Username requirements:
# - Must start with a lowercase letter [a-z]
# - Can contain lowercase letters, numbers, and non-consecutive underscores
# - Cannot end with an underscore
# - Examples: admin, user1, my_user, test123

# Password requirements:
# - Use strong passwords
# - The bcrypt hash is generated automatically by htpasswd
# - Cost factor 12 is recommended for security
